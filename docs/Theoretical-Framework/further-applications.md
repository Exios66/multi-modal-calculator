# Future Research Expansions

If gist-based processing represents advanced cognition yet imposes lower mental workload, this suggests that training approaches should focus on developing meaningful gist extraction skills rather than emphasizing verbatim recall. In educational contexts, “helping students develop robust gist representations of core concepts might prove more effective than emphasizing verbatim recall of details, particularly for promoting conceptual transfer and application.”

* This approach might be particularly valuable in high-stress domains where mental workload management is crucial. By training professionals to extract meaningful gist representations efficiently, performance might be maintained even under conditions of high cognitive load.

* Since “gist-based interventions that explained why misinformation was false (rather than just labeling it as false) were more effective”, information designed to facilitate appropriate gist extraction may reduce unnecessary cognitive burden while ensuring essential meaning is conveyed.

* In contexts like healthcare, where patients make important decisions based on risk information, FTT explains why “numerical risk information often fails to influence behavior as expected”. Patients typically default to gist memories rather than verbatim details within minutes of receiving health information, highlighting the importance of designing communications that support meaningful gist formation rather than focusing exclusively on numerical precision (Edelson & Reyna, 2022).

* Future research might productively explore how to measure and quantify the mental workload differences between gist and verbatim processing across various decision contexts, and how individual differences in representation preferences influence experienced workload. The practical applications of these insights extend to education, healthcare communication, interface design, and other domains where supporting effective decision-making while managing cognitive demands remains a central challenge.
